## Unit 6 | Assignment - What's the Weather Like?



This program utilizes the Twitter api to measure news outlet sentiments of the last 100 tweet by 5 news outlets.  The program takes in a 
list of 5 news agencies and stores the compound tweets as a list in a dictionary.  The dictionary of lists is then converted to a dataframe
and then a scatterplot.  For the bar graphs, the program will sum the total compound sentiments, and then output a bar graph with the totals
for each news outlet.  

As for the API key, it is stored in a separate file call "apikeys", which is imported as a dependency.  So to run the program, please be 
aware of this feature.  Thank you.
